# Medium post

This repository showcases different approaches to build the **Recommendation System** and focusing on **data science**.

From this series of notebooks, you will learn:
- Concept of the modern recommendation system
- Mathematics behind the matrix factorization model
- Item-Item Collaborative Filtering recommendation system
- Improvement to the memory based model recommendation system


## Blog post
The blog post contains more details of each approaches.
