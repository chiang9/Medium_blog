# Recommendation_system_pyspark Medium post

This repository showcases different approaches to build the **Recommendation System**.

From this series of notebooks, you will learn:
- Concept of the modern recommendation system
- Mathematics behind the matrix factorization model
- Item-Item Collaborative Filtering recommendation system
- Improvement to the memory based model recommendation system


## Blog post
The blog post contains more details of each approaches. 

- [ALS_model]
- [Basic item-item collaborative filtering model]
- [Extension to the item-item collaborative filtering model]
- [7 Types of Hybrid Recommendation System]

## Data Source
We will be using the movielens dataset (ml-100k).
